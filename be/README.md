## Not Part of Project

Before I got the updated link to the GraphQL API, I wasn't sure if I was going to be tasked with implementing authentication in a full-stack manner so this backend is the residual of creating a full-stack app that could manage authentication and user management through SuperTokens. I was curious to see what I could do within a few hours and was excited to tinker with SuperTokens since they have a self-hosted option that can help with pricing.

See the [full-stack-solution-branch](https://github.com/Tzinov15/frontera-take-home/tree/full-stack-solution-with-auth) to explore more of that work if curious. It is limited and not thoroughly tested Otherwise, this `be` folder is safe to ignore
